---

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Build the Android App

```bash
cd mobile

# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Build Android release
npm run android
# OR for release build:
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
```

### Step 2: Install on Android Device

**Important:** Must use a **physical Android device**, not an emulator.

```bash
# Connect Android device via USB with USB debugging enabled
# OR use the development build:
npm run android

# For release APK:
# APK location: mobile/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
# Install via: adb install -r app-release.apk
```

### Step 3: Upload ESP32 Code

```bash
# Open Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
# Open: ESP32_Scanner_TFT/ESP32_Scanner_TFT.ino
# Upload to ESP32 device
```

---

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Check BLE Support

1. **Open mobile app**
2. **Log in** (or register)
3. **Watch console logs** (use `npx react-native log-android`)

**Expected logs:**
```
BLE Advertising: Native support = true
```

If you see `false`, your device doesn't support BLE advertising (try a different device).

---

### Test 2: Verify Broadcasting

1. **Register for an event**
2. **Activate the event** (via scanner or admin panel)
3. **Check banner at top of EventsScreen**

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Blue banner: "üîµ Broadcasting via BLE - Scanner can detect you"
- ‚úÖ Green indicator on event card: "‚úì Auto-broadcasting enabled"

**If simulation mode:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Orange banner: "‚ö†Ô∏è Simulation Mode - Use QR code for attendance"
- Device doesn't support native BLE advertising

---

### Test 3: Scanner Detection

#### 3a. Check ESP32 Serial Output

```
Expected logs:
=== SCANNING ACTIVATED ===
Event: Test Event
Registered devices: 1
  - ATT-USER-12345678
Looking for devices with 'ATT-' prefix
Starting BLE scan for 3000ms...

Found BLE device with service UUID: 00001234-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
Extracted UUID from service data: ATT-USER-12345678
Found BLE device: ATT-USER-12345678 (RSSI: -45)
Found registered device: ATT-USER-12345678
Recording attendance...
‚úì Attendance recorded successfully
```

#### 3b. Verify Backend

```bash
# Check attendance records in Convex dashboard
# Navigate to: https://dashboard.convex.dev
# Select your project ‚Üí Data ‚Üí attendance table
# Should see new attendance record
```

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "BLE Advertising: Native support = false"

**Cause:** Device doesn't support BLE advertising

**Solutions:**
1. Try a different Android device (must support BLE 5.0+)
2. Check Android version (must be 5.0+, recommended 8.0+)
3. Enable Bluetooth in device settings
4. Check Bluetooth hardware: Settings ‚Üí About Phone ‚Üí look for BLE support

---

### Issue: "Permission denied" errors

**Cause:** Missing Bluetooth permissions

**Solution:**
```bash
# Android 12+: Grant permissions manually
1. Open app
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Attendance Tracker ‚Üí Permissions
3. Enable:
   - Bluetooth
   - Location (required for BLE on Android)
   - Nearby devices (Android 12+)
```

Or trigger permission request:
- App will auto-request on first broadcast attempt

---

### Issue: Scanner not detecting device

**Possible causes:**

#### 1. **Device too far away**
- **Fix:** Move Android device closer to scanner (within 10m)
- Check RSSI in scanner logs (should be > -80 dBm)

#### 2. **Advertising not started**
- **Check:** Is event active?
- **Check:** Is user registered for event?
- **Check:** Does banner show "Broadcasting via BLE"?

#### 3. **UUID mismatch**
- **Check mobile logs:**
  ```bash
  npx react-native log-android | grep "BLE"
  ```
  Look for: `[NATIVE] Started BLE advertising with UUID: ATT-USER-XXXXXXXX`

- **Check scanner logs:**
  Look for: `Registered devices: X`
  Should match user's UUID

#### 4. **Service UUID mismatch**
- ESP32 looks for: `00001234-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`
- Android advertises with same UUID
- If modified, ensure both match

---

### Issue: "Simulation Mode" on Android

**Cause:** Native module failed to initialize

**Debug steps:**

1. **Check build logs:**
   ```bash
   cd mobile/android
   ./gradlew clean build --info
   ```
   Look for Java compilation errors

2. **Check native module registration:**
   ```bash
   npx react-native log-android | grep "BleAdvertising"
   ```

3. **Rebuild app:**
   ```bash
   cd mobile/android
   ./gradlew clean
   cd ..
   npm run android
   ```

4. **Check for linking errors:**
   - Ensure `BleAdvertisingPackage` is added to `MainApplication.kt`
   - Verify package name: `com.attendancetracker.app`

---

### Issue: ESP32 shows "0 registered devices"

**Cause:** Backend data not synced

**Solution:**
```bash
# Deploy backend changes
cd backend
npx convex deploy

# Run setup script
node test-mvp.js
```

---

### Issue: Advertising stops after app backgrounded

**Cause:** Android aggressively kills background processes

**Solutions:**

1. **Disable battery optimization:**
   ```
   Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Attendance Tracker ‚Üí Battery ‚Üí Unrestricted
   ```

2. **Keep app in foreground:**
   - Don't close app
   - Keep screen on during testing

3. **Future enhancement:** Implement foreground service
   ```java
   // Add notification and foreground service
   // Prevents Android from killing the app
   ```

---

## üì± Device Compatibility

### ‚úÖ Tested & Working:
- Google Pixel (3+)
- Samsung Galaxy (S8+)
- OnePlus (6+)
- Most Android 8.0+ devices with BLE 5.0

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited Support:
- Android 5.0-7.1: Works but limited range
- Tablets: Hit or miss (check BLE specs)

### ‚ùå Not Supported:
- Android < 5.0
- Devices without BLE hardware
- iOS (Apple doesn't allow custom BLE advertising)

---

## üîç Debugging Tips

### Enable Verbose Logging

**Android:**
```bash
# Watch all logs
npx react-native log-android

# Filter for BLE
npx react-native log-android | grep -E "(BLE|Bluetooth)"
```

**ESP32:**
```cpp
// Already enabled in code
Serial.println(...); // Prints to Serial Monitor
// Baud rate: 115200
```

### Check Advertising Packet

Use **nRF Connect** app (Nordic Semiconductor):
1. Install from Play Store
2. Open app
3. Scan for devices
4. Look for UUID: `00001234-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB`
5. Check "Service Data" field
6. Should contain: `ATT-USER-XXXXXXXX`

### Monitor Bluetooth

```bash
# Enable HCI logging (Android)
Developer Options ‚Üí Bluetooth HCI snoop log ‚Üí Enable

# View logs
adb pull /sdcard/Android/data/btsnoop_hci.log
# Analyze with Wireshark
```

---

## üéØ Expected Results

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:

1. **Mobile App:**
   - Blue banner: "Broadcasting via BLE"
   - Console: `[NATIVE] Successfully started BLE advertising`
   - No errors in logs

2. **ESP32 Scanner:**
   - Serial: `Found BLE device: ATT-USER-XXXXXXXX`
   - Serial: `Extracted UUID from service data: ATT-USER-XXXXXXXX`
   - Serial: `Recording attendance...`
   - Display: Shows attendance count increasing

3. **Backend:**
   - New record in `attendance` table
   - `timestamp` matches current time
   - `method` = "scanner"
   - No duplicate entries (within 5 minutes)

---

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Typical Values:

- **Advertising start time:** < 1 second
- **Scanner detection time:** 1-5 seconds (depends on scan duration)
- **Attendance recording time:** < 1 second (network dependent)
- **BLE range:** 10-30 meters (open space)
- **Battery impact:** ~5-10% per hour (with screen off)

### Optimization Tips:

1. **Reduce scan frequency:**
   ```cpp
   // ESP32_Scanner_TFT.ino
   #define BLE_SCAN_DURATION 5000 // Increase to 5s
   ```

2. **Adjust advertising power:**
   ```java
   // BleAdvertisingModule.java, line 119
   .setTxPowerLevel(AdvertiseSettings.ADVERTISE_TX_POWER_MEDIUM) // Change to MEDIUM
   ```

3. **Lower scan window:**
   ```cpp
   // ble_scanner.cpp, line 56
   pBLEScan->setWindow(50); // Reduce from 99
   ```

---

## üîê Security Considerations

### Current Implementation:
- ‚úÖ UUID transmitted in BLE service data
- ‚úÖ API key required for attendance recording
- ‚úÖ Backend validates event registration
- ‚ö†Ô∏è UUID is not encrypted (visible to nearby scanners)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Spoofing possible (anyone can broadcast any UUID)

### Production Enhancements:
1. Add cryptographic signing to UUIDs
2. Rotate UUIDs periodically
3. Implement challenge-response authentication
4. Use encrypted service data

---

## üìù Next Steps

### Enhancements to Consider:

1. **Foreground Service** (prevents backgrounding)
   ```java
   // Add notification + foreground service
   // Keeps advertising alive when app backgrounded
   ```

2. **QR Code Fallback** (for iOS & unsupported devices)
   ```bash
   npm install react-native-qrcode-svg
   # Show QR code with UUID for manual scanning
   ```

3. **Range Indicator** (show distance to scanner)
   ```typescript
   // Use RSSI to estimate distance
   // Show visual indicator in app
   ```

4. **Attendance History** (show past attendance)
   ```typescript
   // Add screen to view attendance records
   // Show timestamps, events, method (BLE/QR/manual)
   ```
