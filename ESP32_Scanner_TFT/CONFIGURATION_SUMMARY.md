4. **BLE Scanning**: Configured to scan for devices with "ATT-" prefix
5. **Web Interface**: Available for configuration changes
6. **TFT Display**: Menu-driven interface ready
7. **LED Indicators**: Status and scanning feedback

### 🔧 What You Need to Configure
1. **WiFi Credentials**: Set your WiFi SSID and password via web interface
   - **For open networks**: Leave password field empty or set to `""`
   - **For secured networks**: Enter the WiFi password
2. **Event Selection**: Choose which event to scan for via TFT menu
3. **Scanner ID**: Change if you have multiple scanners (optional)

## 📋 Configuration Methods

### Method 1: Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Power on ESP32
2. Connect to WiFi hotspot "ESP32-Scanner" (password: "attendance123")
3. Open browser to `http://192.168.4.1`
4. Configure WiFi credentials
5. Set event ID if needed

### Method 2: TFT Display Menu
1. Use UP/DOWN buttons to navigate
2. Press ENTER to select options
3. Navigate to Settings → WiFi Config
4. Set event via Events menu

### Method 3: Serial Commands
1. Open Serial Monitor at 115200 baud
2. Send configuration commands via serial

## 🔍 Testing the Configuration

### 1. Verify Backend Connection
- Check Serial Monitor for "WiFi connected" message
- Look for "Backend Connected" status
- Monitor sync operations

### 2. Test BLE Scanning
- Use mobile app to broadcast BLE UUID with "ATT-" prefix
- Watch TFT display for scanning activity
- Check blue LED for scanning indicator

### 3. Verify Data Sync
- Check backend dashboard for attendance records
- Monitor sync success in Serial Monitor
- Verify records appear in admin interface

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Backend Connection Issues
- Verify backend URL is correct: `https://compassionate-yak-763.convex.cloud/http`
- Check API key: `att_3sh4fmd2u14ffisevqztm`
- Ensure backend is running and accessible

### WiFi Connection Issues
- ESP32 will create AP mode if WiFi fails
- Connect to "ESP32-Scanner" hotspot
- Configure WiFi via web interface

### Open WiFi Networks (No Password)
- **Configuration**: Leave password field empty or set to `""`
- **Example**: `"wifi_password": ""`
- **Web Interface**: Leave password field blank
- **Serial Monitor**: Will show "Connecting to open network (no password)"

### BLE Scanning Issues
- Ensure mobile app is broadcasting BLE UUID
- Check UUID starts with "ATT-" prefix
- Verify device is within range (RSSI > -80 dBm)

## 📊 Monitoring

### Serial Monitor Output
- System status messages
- WiFi connection status
- BLE scan results
- Data sync operations
- Error messages

### TFT Display
- Current menu selection
- System status
- Scanning activity
- Device count

### LED Indicators
- **Yellow LED**: System status (on=ready, blink=connecting/syncing)
- **Blue LED**: Scanning activity (blink=scanning, off=idle)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Upload the code** to your ESP32
2. **Configure WiFi** via web interface
3. **Select an event** via TFT menu
4. **Test with mobile app** broadcasting BLE UUID
5. **Monitor attendance** in backend dashboard

The system is now fully configured and ready for immediate use!
