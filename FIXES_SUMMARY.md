# Attendance System Fixes - Complete Summary

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **Unknown User Issue** - FIXED
**Problem**: Users showing as "Unknown User" instead of their actual names.

**Root Cause**: Users need to be created in the database before the ESP32 can identify them.

**Solution**: 
- Updated admin interface to use `getEventAttendanceWithUsers` and `getEventAttendanceSummaries`
- Created setup script to create test users with BLE UUIDs
- Backend properly looks up users by BLE UUID

### 2. **Duplicate Entries Issue** - FIXED  
**Problem**: Same user being recorded multiple times instead of recognizing duplicates.

**Root Cause**: System wasn't properly checking for existing attendance records.

**Solution**:
- Implemented proper duplicate detection in `batchRecordAttendance`
- Added logic to check for existing attendance records per user/event
- Returns "duplicate" status instead of creating new records

### 3. **Missing Attendance Percentages** - FIXED
**Problem**: No attendance percentage calculation based on scan frequency.

**Solution**:
- Added `attendanceSummary` table for storing calculated percentages
- Implemented `calculateAttendancePercentage` function
- Added automatic recalculation when new attendance is recorded
- Updated admin interface to display percentages with visual progress bars

### 4. **Screen Orientation** - ALREADY CORRECT
**Status**: ESP32 display is already set to landscape orientation (`tft.setRotation(1)`)

## ðŸš€ How to Use the Fixed System

### Step 1: Setup Test Data
```bash
node setup_test_data.js
```
This creates test users with BLE UUIDs and an active event.

### Step 2: Upload ESP32 Code
- Open `ESP32_Scanner_TFT.ino` in Arduino IDE
- Upload to your ESP32
- The display will be in landscape orientation

### Step 3: Configure ESP32
- Connect to ESP32's WiFi access point
- Configure your WiFi credentials
- Select the "Test Event - ESP32 Scanner" event

### Step 4: Start Scanning
- ESP32 will automatically scan for BLE devices
- Users will be identified by their actual names
- No duplicate entries will be created
- Attendance percentages will be calculated automatically

## ðŸ“Š What You'll See Now

### Admin Interface:
- **Unique Users**: Each user appears only once (no duplicates)
- **Real Names**: Users show their actual names, not "Unknown User"
- **Attendance Percentages**: Visual progress bars showing attendance rates
- **Detailed Metrics**: Scan counts, first/last seen timestamps
- **Color-coded Indicators**: Green (â‰¥80%), Yellow (â‰¥60%), Red (<60%)

### ESP32 Scanner:
- **Landscape Display**: Screen is properly oriented
- **Real-time Logging**: Shows user names in serial output
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Won't log the same user multiple times
- **Automatic Sync**: Data syncs to production server

## ðŸ”§ Technical Changes Made

### Backend (`backend/convex/attendance.ts`):
- Added `batchRecordAttendance` internal function
- Added `calculateAttendancePercentage` function
- Added `getEventAttendanceSummaries` query
- Fixed user lookup by BLE UUID
- Implemented duplicate prevention

### Admin Interface (`admin/src/app/events/[id]/page.tsx`):
- Updated to use `getEventAttendanceSummaries`
- Added attendance percentage display with progress bars
- Shows unique users instead of duplicate entries
- Added detailed metrics (scans, timestamps)

### ESP32 Code:
- Already properly configured for production server
- Already set to landscape orientation
- Sends correct data format to backend

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready to Test!

1. **Run setup script**: `node setup_test_data.js`
2. **Upload ESP32 code** to your Arduino
3. **Configure WiFi** on the ESP32
4. **Select event** and start scanning
5. **Check admin interface** for attendance data

The system will now properly:
- âœ… Identify users by their actual names
- âœ… Prevent duplicate attendance records  
- âœ… Calculate attendance percentages
- âœ… Display data in landscape orientation
- âœ… Show detailed attendance reports in admin
