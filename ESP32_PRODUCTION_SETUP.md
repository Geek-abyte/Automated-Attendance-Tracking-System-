# ESP32 Production Setup

## ‚úÖ ESP32 is Ready for Production

Your ESP32 scanner is already properly configured to work with the production Convex server and all the attendance system fixes.

## üîß Configuration

The ESP32 is configured in `scanner-esp32/config.json`:

```json
{
  "wifi_ssid": "GoldBars Internet-EXT",
  "wifi_password": "",
  "backend_url": "https://compassionate-yak-763.convex.cloud/http",
  "api_key": "att_3sh4fmd2u14ffisevqztm",
  "scanner_id": "ESP32-Scanner-01",
  "event_id": "",
  "uuid_prefix": "ATT-",
  "scan_interval": 10
}
```

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Upload the Code
- Open `ESP32_Scanner_TFT.ino` in Arduino IDE
- Upload to your ESP32

### 2. Connect to WiFi
- The ESP32 will create a WiFi access point
- Connect to it and configure your WiFi credentials
- Or update the `config.json` file with your WiFi details

### 3. Select an Event
- Use the web interface (ESP32's IP address) to select an event
- Or use the physical buttons on the ESP32

### 4. Start Scanning
- The ESP32 will automatically start scanning for BLE devices
- It will log attendance records and sync them to the production server

## ‚úÖ What's Fixed and Working

The ESP32 will now:

1. **‚úÖ Identify Users Properly**: Users will show up with their actual names (not "unknown")
2. **‚úÖ Prevent Duplicates**: Same user won't create multiple attendance records
3. **‚úÖ Calculate Percentages**: Attendance percentages are calculated automatically
4. **‚úÖ Sync to Production**: All data goes to your production Convex server

## üìä Data Flow

1. **ESP32 scans** for BLE devices
2. **Logs attendance** records locally
3. **Syncs to production** server via `/batch-checkin` endpoint
4. **Backend processes** records and calculates percentages
5. **Admin interface** shows real-time attendance data

## üîç Monitoring

- Check the Serial Monitor for ESP32 logs
- Use the admin interface to view attendance reports
- All data is stored in your production Convex database

## üéØ Ready to Go!

Your ESP32 scanner is fully configured and ready to work with the production server. Just upload the code and start scanning!
