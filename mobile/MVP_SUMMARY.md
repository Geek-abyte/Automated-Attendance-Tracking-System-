# Mobile App MVP - Complete Implementation

## âœ… What's Been Built

### 1. **Clean Project Structure**
- Fresh React Native Expo project with TypeScript
- Organized source code in `src/` directory
- Proper TypeScript configuration
- Modern app configuration with Bluetooth permissions

### 2. **Core Features Implemented**

#### **Authentication System**
- Login screen with email/password
- Registration screen with user creation
- Persistent authentication using AsyncStorage
- Automatic BLE UUID generation for new users
- Clean, modern UI with proper form validation

#### **Event Management**
- Events screen showing all available events
- Event registration/unregistration functionality
- Real-time event status (Upcoming, Active, Ended)
- Visual indicators for event states
- Pull-to-refresh functionality

#### **Bluetooth Broadcasting**
- Bluetooth context for managing BLE state
- Permission handling for Android/iOS
- Broadcasting simulation for MVP
- Visual indicators when broadcasting is active
- Integration with active events only

#### **User Profile**
- Profile screen with user information
- BLE UUID display and management
- Help section explaining how the app works
- Logout functionality

### 3. **Technical Implementation**

#### **Architecture**
- Context-based state management (Auth, Bluetooth)
- Mock API service for MVP (easily replaceable with real Convex)
- TypeScript throughout for type safety
- Clean separation of concerns

#### **UI/UX**
- Modern, clean design
- Consistent styling and colors
- Responsive layouts
- Loading states and error handling
- Intuitive navigation flow

#### **Data Flow**
1. User registers/logs in â†’ Gets BLE UUID
2. User views events â†’ Can register for events
3. When event is active â†’ User can enable broadcasting
4. App broadcasts BLE UUID â†’ Scanner detects attendance
5. User can manage profile and view status

### 4. **MVP Features**

#### **âœ… Completed**
- User authentication (login/register)
- Event viewing and registration
- BLE UUID generation and management
- Bluetooth broadcasting simulation
- Clean, modern UI
- TypeScript implementation
- Proper error handling
- Loading states

#### **ðŸ”„ Ready for Integration**
- Easy to connect to real Convex backend
- Mock API can be replaced with real API calls
- BLE simulation can be replaced with real BLE advertising
- All data structures match backend schema

### 5. **How to Use**

1. **Start the app**: `npm start` or `npm run android`/`npm run ios`
2. **Register**: Create a new account (gets BLE UUID automatically)
3. **View Events**: See available events and their status
4. **Register for Events**: Tap register button on events you want to attend
5. **Broadcast Attendance**: When an event is active, enable broadcasting
6. **Manage Profile**: View your BLE UUID and account info

### 6. **Next Steps for Production**

1. **Connect to Real Backend**: Replace mock API with Convex functions
2. **Real BLE Implementation**: Replace simulation with actual BLE advertising
3. **Enhanced Security**: Add proper password hashing and validation
4. **Push Notifications**: Notify users about event status changes
5. **Offline Support**: Cache data for offline viewing
6. **Analytics**: Track user engagement and app usage

## ðŸŽ¯ MVP Success Criteria Met

- âœ… **Core Workflow Works**: Register â†’ View Events â†’ Register for Events â†’ Broadcast Attendance
- âœ… **Clean UI**: Modern, intuitive interface
- âœ… **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout
- âœ… **Modular Architecture**: Easy to extend and maintain
- âœ… **Mock Data**: Functional with sample data
- âœ… **Ready for Integration**: Easy to connect to real backend

The mobile app is now a clean, focused MVP that demonstrates the core concept and is ready for testing and integration with the real backend system.
