# ESP32 Timestamp Bug Fix

## Critical Bug Found! üêõ

The ESP32 scanner was sending **invalid timestamps** to the backend, which was likely causing attendance recording to fail.

### The Problem

**Before:**
```cpp
record["timestamp"] = millis(); // WRONG!
```

`millis()` returns the number of milliseconds since the ESP32 booted. For example:
- After 1 minute: `60000`
- After 10 minutes: `600000`

**What the backend expects:**
- Unix timestamp in milliseconds (e.g., `1728142800000` for October 5, 2025)

### The Impact

This bug would cause:
1. **Backend validation errors** - Timestamps in the wrong format
2. **Event time calculation issues** - Backend uses timestamps to auto-populate event start/end times
3. **Attendance summary problems** - Percentage calculations rely on proper timestamps

### The Solution

Added **NTP (Network Time Protocol) synchronization**:

1. **Time Sync on WiFi Connect:**
   ```cpp
   configTime(0, 0, "pool.ntp.org", "time.nist.gov");
   ```
   - Automatically fetches correct time from internet
   - Happens once after WiFi connects
   - Waits up to 5 seconds for sync

2. **New `getCurrentTimestamp()` Function:**
   ```cpp
   unsigned long long getCurrentTimestamp() {
     time_t now;
     time(&now);
     
     if (now < 1000000000) {
       Serial.println("WARNING: Time not synced!");
       return millis(); // Fallback
     }
     
     return ((unsigned long long)now) * 1000ULL;
   }
   ```

3. **Updated Attendance Recording:**
   ```cpp
   record["timestamp"] = getCurrentTimestamp(); // Now sends proper Unix timestamp
   ```

## Changes Made

### `ESP32_Scanner_TFT.ino`

1. **Added `getCurrentTimestamp()` function** (line 220)
   - Returns Unix timestamp in milliseconds
   - Checks if time is synced
   - Warns if time sync failed

2. **Modified `connectToWiFi()` function** (line 263)
   - Added NTP configuration
   - Waits for time sync
   - Logs sync status

3. **Updated `recordAttendanceBatch()` function** (line 509)
   - Changed from `millis()` to `getCurrentTimestamp()`
   - Now sends proper Unix timestamps

## Testing the Fix

After uploading the code, you should see this in Serial Monitor:

```
WiFi connected: 192.168.1.100
Syncing time with NTP...
Time synced: Sat Oct  5 10:30:00 2025

[Later when recording attendance]
Request body: {"records":[{"eventId":"...","bleUuid":"ATT-USER-12P8AJNR","timestamp":1728142800000,...}]}
```

**Key things to verify:**
1. ‚úÖ "Time synced" message appears after WiFi connects
2. ‚úÖ Timestamp in request body is a large number (13 digits, like `1728142800000`)
3. ‚úÖ No "WARNING: Time not synced" messages during attendance recording

## Why This Matters

### Before (Broken):
```json
{
  "records": [{
    "bleUuid": "ATT-USER-12P8AJNR",
    "eventId": "jn7f56bc6vtrdx0tmnmby1cmm57qptfm",
    "timestamp": 60000
  }]
}
```
‚ùå Backend thinks this attendance was recorded on January 1, 1970 at 00:01:00

### After (Fixed):
```json
{
  "records": [{
    "bleUuid": "ATT-USER-12P8AJNR",
    "eventId": "jn7f56bc6vtrdx0tmnmby1cmm57qptfm",
    "timestamp": 1728142800000
  }]
}
```
‚úÖ Backend correctly records October 5, 2025 at 10:30:00

## Fallback Behavior

If NTP sync fails (rare, but possible):
- System still works but logs a warning
- Falls back to `millis()` (incorrect timestamp)
- Attendance may still be recorded but with wrong time
- You'll see: `"WARNING: Time not synced, using millis() - attendance may fail!"`

## Troubleshooting

### If time sync fails:
1. **Check internet access** - NTP requires internet
2. **Try different NTP servers** - Some networks block certain servers
3. **Check firewall** - Port 123 (NTP) must be open
4. **Increase timeout** - Slow networks may need more time

### If you still see connection errors:
- Time sync issue is now fixed ‚úÖ
- But network connectivity issues remain (see `ESP32_NETWORK_FIXES.md`)
- WiFi signal strength still matters

## Status

‚úÖ **Bug Fixed**  
‚úÖ **NTP Sync Added**  
‚úÖ **Proper Unix Timestamps**  
üîÑ **Ready to Upload and Test**
