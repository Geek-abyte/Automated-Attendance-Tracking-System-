# Automated Attendance Tracking System - Development Methodology

## System Architecture Overview

The Automated Attendance Tracking System is a comprehensive solution consisting of four interconnected components that work together to provide automated attendance tracking using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) device identification. The system follows an offline-first architecture where the scanner device operates independently during events and syncs data to the backend when connectivity is available.

## Core Components

The system consists of four main components that form a complete ecosystem:

**Backend (Convex)** - Centralized data storage and real-time synchronization using Convex cloud platform with TypeScript functions, HTTP API endpoints, and automatic schema management.

**Admin Web Interface (Next.js)** - Event management and monitoring dashboard built with Next.js, providing real-time attendance monitoring, event creation, user management, and comprehensive reporting.

**Mobile App (React Native with Expo)** - Cross-platform mobile application for user registration, event browsing, and automatic BLE UUID broadcasting with native Android BLE implementation and iOS simulation fallback.

**ESP32 Scanner Device** - Physical hardware scanner with TFT display, push buttons, and LED indicators that performs BLE scanning, event selection, and attendance recording with offline-first operation and batch synchronization.

## System Workflow Integration

The complete system operates through a sophisticated workflow where administrators create events through the web interface, users register for events via the mobile application, and the ESP32 scanner detects and records attendance automatically. The system supports both online and offline operation with automatic data synchronization when connectivity is available.

The mobile application broadcasts unique BLE UUIDs that are detected by the ESP32 scanner, which verifies user registration and records attendance in the backend. The admin interface provides real-time monitoring and comprehensive reporting of attendance data with percentage-based calculations and detailed analytics.

This methodology ensures a robust, scalable, and user-friendly attendance tracking system that can handle various event scenarios and user requirements while maintaining data integrity and system reliability.
